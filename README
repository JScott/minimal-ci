# Platter

Jenkins is getting more and more obtuse as I try to integrate it into our flow so I'm creating a server to give it a hand.

## /git-push

Bitbucket and Github both have a hook for POSTing on push. It has a lot of relevant data in it which should be used in the Jenkins build but Jenkins fumbles on being able to read it. I could create a plugin I guess but frankly I'd rather not.

Push to this instead and Platter will wrap up the appropriate data and pass it to a paramaterized build via URL.
